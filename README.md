## Joseph Knowles

An endlessly curious human being who recently graduated from university and then Makers Academy. I have a broad range of skills and a particular interest in software design. I'm one of the first people to complete Makers Academy's highly intensive, full time coding bootcamp remotely, where I created a fully functional 'garden sharing' web app in just two weeks. I designed it to match the needs of a real client as part of a small team of developers. I'm hoping to join a jovial work environment with interesting people who will allow me to continue learning at the fast pace I currently am doing, while pushing me into new and exciting areas of emerging technology.

## Skills

#### Ruby

I spent 16 weeks with Makers Academy honing my programming skills with a strong focus on TDD and OOP. I developed core ruby skills following best practices while applying Sandy Metz's Object Oriented Programming guidelines to complete several projects on the course. Then applied these skills to web development by quickly adapting to different frameworks (Rails and Sinatra) to create multiple unique applications.

- For example see my final project [Lend and Tend](http://pacific-tundra-1942.herokuapp.com) the garden sharing app mentioned above, made with 3 other developers and a client who pitched the idea at a charity jamboree in London
- Another application, Chitter, is a well featured (although not the *most* attractive) social network I created alone in one weekend within 5 weeks of starting the course, take a look [here](http://thechitter.herokuapp.com)
- As a pure ruby pursuit I designed an unbeatable, digital 'noughts and crosses' opponent one weekend while completing the pre-course to Makers Academy

#### Git

Git has become an essential part of my programming toolkit and I have relied on many of its features to be extremely productive. We have used it to its full potential including best practice use of branches (as taught by a github employee) to simultaneously deliver separate features and to deploy to separate servers automatically on heroku. It has allowed multiple pairs of us to program on the same project at computers literally thousands of miles apart.

- Every project has been version controlled using git.
- Github used to back up projects and for collaboration.


#### Agile and best practices

I have a practical understanding of core agile concepts and their implementations from applying them to many projects. The agile process was followed strictly throughout the course including: 

- Daily standups
- Pair programming
- Code reviews
- retrospectives

#### Pair programming (including remote pair programming)

I completed the Makers Academy course remotely so I learned by pair programming over videocalls (specifically google hangouts, which I suppose I'm an expert in now). This required that I demonstrate outstanding communication skills to clearly convey programming specifics as well as more abstract software concepts. Despite obvious obstacles we still finished all the same projects as the people completing the course at the London HQ, including an extra group project in our free week.

#### Javascript

On several applications I have displayed solid core javascript skills as well as the ability to pick-up new technologies quickly. As part of the course I gained effective familiarity with various frameworks such as Node.js, Angular and express.js in less than a week.
