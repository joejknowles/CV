## Joseph Knowles

An endlessly curious human being with a broad range of skills and an obsession
with good software design. Two years ago I was part of the first cohort to
complete Makers Academy's highly intensive, full time coding bootcamp remotely.
After Makers Academy I worked in the Czech Republic for a large wealth
management company where I quickly learned and worked with new technologies, and
took on technical lead responsibilities for an important £multi-billion project
within a year of joining the company.

Now I'm looking for an opportunity to use my skills with React.js to efficiently
create excellent user experiences as part of an agile team.

## Skills

### Clean code

The medium- and long-term maintainability and extensibility of code is essential
for highly productive web-development. This is why I am continuously focussed on
understanding and applying both industry standard and emerging techniques for
achieving clean code.

I applied and improved this skill on private projects during previous employment,
my portfolio below contains some examples of me applying this knowledge to small
personal projects. The code is all freely available on GitHub at the links below.

#### Agile / scrum

I was taught the core concepts of agile as part of my
software development training at Makers Academy. The course was  project based,
and  these projects were all completed in an agile manner, while the company
Makers Academy itself adhered closely to agile principles.

My role at my first job after Makers Academy involved agile evangelism. The
company was large and previously worked with waterfall processes. At first I
worked as part of  a small internal agile team to demonstrate the efficacy of
these practices, after that success I moved into client delivery to apply
agile doctrines more widely within the company.

I like to work within modern project management frameworks like agile. I get the
most work satisfaction knowing I'm building experiences that are most useful to
end users, and these iterative frameworks ensure this is done effectively in the
shortest time possible.

I have a practical understanding of core agile concepts and their implementations from applying them to many projects. The agile process was followed strictly throughout the course including:

- Daily standups
- Pair programming
- Code reviews
- retrospectives

#### Pair programming (including remote pair programming)

I completed the Makers Academy course remotely so I learned by pair programming over videocalls (specifically google hangouts, which I suppose I'm an expert in now). This required that I demonstrate outstanding communication skills to clearly convey programming specifics as well as more abstract software concepts. Despite obvious obstacles we still finished all the same projects as the people completing the course at the London HQ, including an extra group project in our free week.

#### Javascript

On several applications I have displayed solid core javascript skills as well as the ability to pick-up new technologies quickly. As part of the course I gained effective familiarity with various frameworks such as Node.js, Angular and express.js in less than a week.

## Education
