## Joseph Knowles

An endlessly curious human being with a broad range of skills and an obsession
with good software design. Two years ago I was part of the first cohort to
complete Makers Academy's highly intensive, full time coding bootcamp remotely.
After Makers Academy I worked in the Czech Republic for a large wealth
management company where I quickly learned and worked with new technologies, and
took on technical lead responsibilities for an important £multi-billion project
within a year of joining the company.

I'm looking for an opportunity to use my skills with ReactJS to efficiently
create excellent user experiences as part of an agile team.

## Skills

### Clean code

The medium- and long-term maintainability and extensibility of code is essential
for highly productive web-development. This is why I am continually focussed on
understanding and applying both industry standard and emerging techniques for
achieving cleaner code.

I applied and improved this skill on the company's applications during previous employment,
my portfolio below contains some examples of me applying this knowledge to small
personal projects. The code is all freely available on GitHub at the links below.

#### Agile / scrum

I was taught the core concepts of agile as part of my
software development training at Makers Academy. The course was  project based,
and  these projects were all completed in an agile manner. The company
Makers Academy itself adhered closely to agile principles, giving me first
hand experience of the agile processes within an extremely successful start up
early on in my career.

My role at my first job after Makers Academy involved agile evangelism. The
company was large and previously worked with waterfall processes. At first I
worked as part of  a small internal agile team to demonstrate the efficacy of
these practices, after that success I moved into client delivery to apply
agile doctrines more widely within the company.

I like to work within modern project management frameworks like agile. I get the
most work satisfaction knowing I'm building experiences that are most useful to
end users, and these iterative frameworks ensure this is done effectively in the
shortest time possible.

#### TDD & BDD

Test Driven Development is foundational to my approach to software. It was a
central part of my initial training, and has continued to guide my work on
personal projects which can be seen it my portfolio. The same is true for BDD,
my portfolio includes a small wrapper for PhantomJS, which makes
testing of user interactions on a node/express application simple within Facebook's
Jest framework.

#### Pair programming (including remote pair programming)

I completed the Makers Academy course remotely so I learned by pair programming
over video-calls (specifically google hangouts, which I suppose I'm an expert in
now). This required that I demonstrate outstanding communication skills to
clearly convey programming specifics as well as more abstract software concepts.
Despite obvious obstacles we still finished all the same projects as the people
completing the course at the London HQ, including an extra group project in our
free week.

###Technologies Summary - learned a variety, now focussed on ...

#### Ruby

I spent 16 weeks with Makers Academy developing exceptional programming
capabilities with a strong focus on TDD and OOP. I mastered core ruby skills,
following best practices while applying Sandy Metz's Object Oriented Programming
guidelines, to complete several projects on the course. Then applied these
skills to web development by quickly adapting to different frameworks (Rails and
Sinatra) to create multiple unique web-applications.

#### Git

Git has become an essential part of my programming toolkit and I have relied on
many of its features to be extremely productive. We have used it to its full
potential including best practice use of branches (as taught by a github
employee) to simultaneously deliver separate features and to deploy to separate
servers automatically on heroku. It has allowed multiple pairs of us to program
on the same project at computers literally thousands of miles apart.

- Every project has been version controlled using git. Github used to back up
- projects and for collaboration.

#### Javascript
